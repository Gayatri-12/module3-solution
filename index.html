Baby Corn Recipes- If you are looking for texture in your salad without an overpowering flavour then this sun-kissed yellow, 
crunchy and crispy baby corn is the answer to your quest and also one of the season's most prized possessions. It goes well with many
 vegetables, can be cooked easily and can also eaten raw. Sometimes known as 'candle corn', it's harvested while the stalks are very small
 and immature. It tastes a bit like regular corn but is lighter and much softer.
Thailand is one of the biggest producers of baby corn which is why it's used generously in Asian cooking. India also produces a lot of its 
baby corn but its commercial value still seems to tilt towards the higher side. There are special varieties of corn that have been developed 
specifically to produce more ears per stalk, making baby corn easier to harvest but the vegetables need to be harvested by hand which 
needs a lot of manual labour. The most common types of corn can produce baby corn and so some farms use the same stalk to harvest
 baby corn and regular corn later on.
Corn is considered a starchy vegetable because of its carbohydrate content, but baby corn has the make-up of a non-starchy one. 
It has several health benefits and can keep your appetite in check. It's rich in proteins, vitamins, iron and phosphorus and a great source 
of fiber.Baby corn is a good choice for those trying to stay fit which is why baby corn soup and a simple, mildly spiced stir fry are
 recommended. It's also rich in Vitamin C, E and antioxidants which work wonders for the hair and Baby corn also controls cholesterol 
and anaemia.

<section id="stuffed_brinjal">
<p class="style">Stuffed Brinjal Curry, also popularly referred as “Gutti Vankaya Fry” is a very common and popular dry curry made 
with masala stuffed brinjal. Tender brinjals are washed, pat dry and then slit into 4, are then stuffed with freshly ground masala and 
cooked in low flame till the brinjal are tender. The left over masala from stuffing is also cooked along with the brinjal making this curry
 so appealing and appetizing! I usually like serving this Stuffed Brinjal curry with hot steaming rasam rice!
Stuffed Brinjal Curry is a popular Indian cuisine eggplant curry of Andra Pradesh and Telangana, especially in Hyderabad.
 The stuffed brinjal curry is a popular dish in Pakistan too, which is served as a side dish of biriyani. You can eat it along with rice, roti,

<p class="style">Kadai mushroom recipe With step by step photos – Kadai mushroom Is an easy and quick dish and yet delicious.
 Sauteed button mushrooms in a semi dry gravy of spiced and tangy tomato sauce along with bell peppers (capsicum).
The kadai mushroom recipe can be made spicy and hot depending on the kind of red chilies you add. Dry red chilies are added to make 
the kadai masala. So if you use hot chilies, the curry will be hot. If you use less hot and pungent chilies, the gravy will not be hot.
 So depending on the heat in the chilies, you can decrease or increase their amount. Here I used byadagi chilies which are less hot and 
give a deep color.
